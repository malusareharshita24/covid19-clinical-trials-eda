# 🧪 COVID-19 Clinical Trials EDA

This repository contains an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a global dataset of COVID-19 clinical trials. The analysis uncovers trends in study types, locations, and trial timelines, using Python, SQL (SQLite), and Pandas.

## 📌 Features  

✅ **Real-World Dataset** - Analysis of clinical trials related to COVID-19 from diverse global sources.  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Identifies trends in trial types, locations, and COVID-specific studies using Pandas.  
✅ **Clean & Modular Project Structure** - Follows best practices with organized folders for data, notebooks, scripts, and documentation.  
✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** - Handles missing values, standardizes column names, and prepares data for insights.  
✅ **Visualizations** - Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib to show: Study type distribution, Top 10 countries conducting trials, COVID keyword-based filtering, and Trends over time (e.g. study start dates)  
✅ **SQL-Based Analysis (SQLite)** - Simulates real-world analytical queries using SQL on the dataset.  
✅ **COVID-Specific Filtering** - Filters trials based on title keywords to isolate COVID-focused research.
